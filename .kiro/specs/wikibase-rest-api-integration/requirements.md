# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates the Wikibase REST API using the @wmde/wikibase-rest-api package to fetch live data for the wikibase schema editor. The integration will enable users to work with real-time property information, constraints, validations, and other metadata directly from Wikibase instances, enhancing the schema editing experience with accurate and up-to-date information.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data analyst using the wikibase schema editor, I want to fetch live property information from Wikibase instances, so that I can work with accurate and current property definitions when building my schemas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a Wikibase instance THEN the system SHALL establish a connection using the @wmde/wikibase-rest-api package
2. WHEN a user searches for properties THEN the system SHALL retrieve property information including labels, descriptions, and data types from the live Wikibase instance
3. WHEN property data is fetched THEN the system SHALL display the most current information available from the Wikibase REST API
4. IF the Wikibase instance is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and fallback to cached data if available

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a schema editor user, I want to access property constraints and validation rules from live Wikibase data, so that I can ensure my schema mappings comply with the target Wikibase's requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a property THEN the system SHALL fetch associated constraint information from the Wikibase REST API
2. WHEN constraint data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL display validation rules, allowed values, and format requirements
3. WHEN building schema mappings THEN the system SHALL validate user input against live constraint data
4. IF constraint validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about which constraints are violated

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working with the schema editor, I want the system to cache Wikibase API responses efficiently, so that repeated requests don't impact performance and API rate limits are respected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate caching mechanisms to reduce redundant calls
2. WHEN cached data exists and is fresh THEN the system SHALL use cached responses instead of making new API calls
3. WHEN cache expires or is invalidated THEN the system SHALL fetch fresh data from the Wikibase REST API
4. IF API rate limits are approached THEN the system SHALL implement backoff strategies and queue management

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure multiple Wikibase instances for API integration, so that users can work with different knowledge bases depending on their project requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring Wikibase instances THEN the system SHALL allow specification of base URLs, authentication credentials, and instance metadata
2. WHEN instance configuration is saved THEN the system SHALL validate connectivity and API compatibility
3. WHEN switching between instances THEN the system SHALL maintain separate caches and configurations for each instance
4. WHEN setting up instances THEN the system SHALL support both custom configuration and pre-defined instance lists (such as Wikidata, Wikimedia Commons, etc.)
5. IF instance configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and prevent system malfunction

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a schema editor user, I want to see real-time validation feedback based on live Wikibase constraints, so that I can identify and fix schema issues before attempting to upload data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN editing schema mappings THEN the system SHALL continuously validate against live constraint data
2. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL highlight problematic mappings with specific error descriptions
3. WHEN constraints are satisfied THEN the system SHALL provide positive feedback indicating valid mappings
4. IF constraint data cannot be fetched THEN the system SHALL indicate when validation is based on cached or incomplete information
